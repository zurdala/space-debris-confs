# Conferences and events related to Space Debris

It aims to include most conferences, congresses, workshops... that are somewhat related to the topic of space debris and space situational awareness (SSA) in their programme, or that could be of interest for people working in those topics, e.g. astrodynamics tools. 

## How to contribute

Either open a new [issue](https://github.com/zurdala/space-debris-confs/issues/new?template=11-new-conference.md) or open a pull request to the [data file](https://github.com/zurdala/space-debris-confs/blob/main/assets/confs.yaml) 

## Plans

- To keep this updated
- To improve the filtering options, so only upcoming events are shown by default and past events are separated
